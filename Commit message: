# Security Policy

Spectre takes security seriously and encourages responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please email:

**security@spectre.dev**

Please include:

- Description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes

We ask that reporters **do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities**, including opening GitHub issues, until a fix is released.

## Scope

This policy applies to:

- Spectre Core (Solana program)
- Spectre SDKs
- Relayer reference implementations
- Documentation and scripts

## Cryptography Notice

Spectre uses hashing primitives (SHA-256, Blake3) and Merkle-based commitments.  
The system does **not** provide full zero-knowledge privacy, and should not be treated as such.

## Rewards

At this time, Spectre does not operate a bounty program, but we do publicly acknowledge valid reports unless anonymity is requested.
